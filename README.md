How to Install a Virtual Environment using Venv
Virtualenv is a tool to set up your Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. You can install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:

## python -m venv venv


## venv\Scripts\activate


## pip install -r requirements.txt -v


then download any of the project folder and paste it where the venv is located(outside)
